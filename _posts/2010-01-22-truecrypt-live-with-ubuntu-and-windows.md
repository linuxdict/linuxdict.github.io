Now the enviorment:

Windows already installed and Truecrypt encrypt the whole disk. and install Ubuntu and keep Windows.

After Ubuntu installed, the Windows disappear.

Reason/Solution: Windows is encrypted with Truecrypt, so Ubuntu can&#8217;t detect the system and generate the dual-boot menu.

so we need to use &#8220;Truecrypt Rescue CD&#8221;, insert it into the computer and restart it. Then it will show: &#8220;&#8230;Install hiding operating system&#8221;

choose &#8220;No&#8221;, then it will ask your password, input your password and then go to Windows now. default it will boot into Ubuntu.

after boot into Windows. â€œpermanently decrypt&#8221; &#8230;.then grub-install /dev/sda

we got dual-boot menu. if any better idea to keep Truecrypt with Windows. share your idea. Thanks.
