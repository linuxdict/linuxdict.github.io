Seems it&#8217;s a old wireless Router. no new firmware released now.

Why I want to upgrade firmeware ? just for fun. didn&#8217;t feel much improvement. ðŸ™‚
  
Just got a official link
  
http://osdn.jp/projects/sfnet\_officiallinksysfirmware/downloads/wap4400n/1.2.19/WAP4400N\_GPL_v1.2.19.tar.bz2/

I had to use an GCC 3.x box. so I choose CentOS 4.8. so old.

Download firmware from above link, following the cross compile guide. will be straight forward.
  
Packages installed: gcc bison flex gcc-c++ zlib-devel
  
After a looong compile. got the new firemware 1.2.19.

Upgrade by your own risk ðŸ™‚
