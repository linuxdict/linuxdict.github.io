For who reach my old site. I just migrated from Wordpress to Jekyll. Haven't update this site for a while. But don't want get notes lost I made that may help someone. so I migrated to Jekyll just for record purpose. Forgive me if there is code style issue.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
