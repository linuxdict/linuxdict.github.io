昨天把Hypertable+KFS搞定了。

今天没什么事了，看看一些技术性文章
  
performance-research from yahoo.com

1. Reducing the number of HTTP requests has the biggest impact on reducing response time and is often the easiest performance improvement to make
  
很实话，呵呵，减少请求当然是首选，然后就是推出缓存问题了。

2. Keep in mind the empty cache user experience. It might be more prevalent than you think!
  
就是在做客户端缓存的时候，不要忘记没有缓存的用户。客户端缓存不要做得太狠

3.Eliminate unnecessary cookies;
  
Keep cookie sizes as low as possible to minimize the impact on the user response time;
  
Be mindful of setting cookies at the appropriate domain level so other sub-domains are not affected.
  
Set an Expires date appropriately. An earlier Expires date or none removes the cookie sooner, improving the user response time.
  
Cookies也是问题的时候可见服务器流量之大了，呵呵，yahoo技术上确实。

4. Our rule of thumb is to increase the number of parallel downloads by using at least two, but no more than four hostnames. Once again, this underscores the number one rule for improving response times: reduce the number of components in the page.
  
DNS寻址时间也算进去？佩服！增加
