My nagstamon crashed sometimes and the configuration lost.

but can&#8217;t find where the hell configuration is. so got the solution: define the configuration manually.

> Everything should get at its place and you can start it from Start menu/Programs/nagstamon. When run from command line with &#8220;nagstamon&#8221; you can pass a configfile like &#8220;nagstamon configfile&#8221; in case you want to store it at another place than default. It starts automatically at login. Details: http://nagstamon.sourceforge.net/setup/

Now my shortcut looks like: &#8220;C:\Program Files\nagstamon\nagstamon.exe&#8221; nagconfig.conf
  
The configuration lays in C:\Program Files\nagstamon\nagconfig.conf , good news it also encryto the password. cool ðŸ™‚
